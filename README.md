1. Introduction
Mathematical notation is crucial for communicating complex ideas in education, research, and professional fields. Converting mathematical images, such as handwritten equations or scanned documents, into LaTeX is often error-prone and time-intensive. Although effective for general text recognition, traditional OCR systems need help with the complexity of mathematical syntax, including nested structures, unique symbols, and variable formats. These limitations result in significant inefficiencies, particularly in academia and research, where the demand for digitized content is growing. Integrating the Donut and mBART architectures provides an innovative solution to these challenges. This framework combines advanced vision and language models to automate transcription processes, improving speed and accuracy. This research lays a foundation for developing tools that enhance collaboration, learning, and accessibility in a digital world.

2. Problem Statement
Mathematical analysis is one of the most challenging problems due to the variability and complexity of visual data. Generally speaking, computer vision requires extracting relevant information from images and videos, which requires precise modeling of high-dimensional data. Various factors, including noise, contrast, distortions, and potentially varying image sizes, make it challenging to develop a practical algorithm. In order to attempt to complete this task, highly demanding mathematical calculations are necessary for these models to process images, which require linear algebra, calculus, and statistics. A particular model would need to perform well and be scalable since they typically would have to work with large datasets or strict latency constraints. In mathematical analysis, models that perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) often struggle to recognize mathematical text because many file formats lack semantic information for these expressions. A model to transcribe mathematical expression effectively can be helpful in various areas of education, research, and accessibility. This can be used for automated grading of student's handwritten exams, quickly transcribing mathematical manuscripts, and helping individuals with visual impairments understand mathematical concepts through text-to-speech tools.

3. Methodology

3.1 Model Architecture
The Donut + mBART framework is a unique and innovative approach to converting mathematical images into LaTeX code. It consists of three main components, each contributing to the transcription process. The Donut encoder, built on the Swin Transformer architecture, processes images by dividing them into 4×4 patches and hierarchically extracting visual features. This design captures local details, such as individual symbols, and global structures, such as relationships within an equation. The mBART decoder translates these features into LaTeX commands using cross-attention mechanisms, ensuring high accuracy in transcription. Finally, the tokenizer converts token IDs into human-readable LaTeX commands with a vocabulary of 50,000 tokens, allowing the precise representation of even the most complex mathematical syntax.

3.2 Training Process
The model was rigorously trained on the CROHME dataset, which includes 27,000 images of handwritten mathematical expressions. Preprocessing steps ensured consistency, with images resized to 224x560 pixels, padded for alignment, and enhanced for contrast to reduce noise. Data augmentation techniques simulated diverse handwriting styles, helping the model generalize better to new data. Optimization strategies, such as gradient checkpointing and reduced batch sizes, enabled training within hardware limitations. Pre-trained weights from similar tasks accelerated convergence, ensuring strong performance despite constraints. Over three epochs, the model processed 53,000 samples, demonstrating robust results across varied datasets.
